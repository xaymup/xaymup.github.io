title: Rediscovering My Voice: A Long Overdue Update
---


It's funny how time flies. The last time I promised to write anything here was in 2019. That's right, it's been years since I’ve thought about expressing my thoughts, experiences, or even a simple update on my personal website. Looking back, I can't help but chuckle at the absurdity of it. How did I let so much time slip by without connecting with this space that once meant so much to me?

The truth is, I've been drained. Corporations have a way of doing that. Squeezing every last drop of energy, creativity, and passion from you. They took the best out of me, consuming my time and leaving me feeling like a husk of my former self. Days turned into months, and months into years, with the grind of corporate life overshadowing everything else.

By the end of last year, I was laid off from my last job. While this initially felt like yet another blow, it turned out to be a blessing in disguise. This unexpected turn of events forced me to reevaluate my priorities and gave me the freedom to rediscover my passions. Since then, I’ve performed two VJ gigs and bought my first DJ rack.

In this whirlwind, I had lost sight of what truly mattered to me: my art and my creativity. I look back and wonder how much more I could have accomplished, how much my music could have developed, and how many more moments of pure artistic expression I could have enjoyed if only I had the work-life balance that gave me the time and energy to focus on things I love.

The world around us doesn't make it any easier. The current state of affairs is disheartening. It feels like every day brings new challenges, new reasons to feel sorry for the way things are. It's easy to get caught up in the negativity, to let it weigh you down and stifle your creative spirit.

But perhaps this reflection is exactly what I needed. It's a wake-up call to reclaim my time, my energy, and my passion. To find a balance between the demands of everyday life and the creative pursuits that bring me joy. To not let another year pass without making an effort to reconnect with my art and my hometown community.

So, here I am, breaking the silence. This post is a promise to myself and to you. A promise to prioritize what I love, to share more often, and to not let the pressures of the world steal my voice again. Let's see where this journey takes us. Thank you for sticking around!
