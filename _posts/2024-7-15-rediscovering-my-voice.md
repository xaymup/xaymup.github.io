title: Rediscovering My Voice, A Long Overdue Update
---


It’s funny how time flies. The last time I promised to write anything here was in 2019. That’s right—it’s been years since I’ve thought about expressing my thoughts, sharing my experiences, or even giving a simple update on my website. Looking back, I can’t help but chuckle at the absurdity of it all. How did I let so much time slip by without reconnecting with this space that once meant so much to me?

The truth is, I’ve been drained. Corporations have a way of doing that, squeezing every last drop of energy, creativity, and passion from you. Corporate life takes the best of you and trades it for cash, leaving you feeling like a husk of your true self. Trapped in a cycle of repetitive days and monotonous Monday mornings, doing the same thing over and over again, days turn into months and months into years, with the grind of corporate life overshadowing everything else.

By the end of last year, I was laid off from my job. While this initially felt like a setback, it turned out to be a blessing in disguise. This unexpected turn of events gave me the freedom to rediscover my true self. Since then, I’ve been able to spend my free time at my computer again, and the constant urge to make the most of every night and weekend has faded.

In this whirlwind, I had lost sight of what truly mattered to me: my art, my creativity, and my i3wm configuration. I look back and wonder how much more I could have accomplished, how many more moments of pure artistic expression I could have enjoyed if only the so-called “work-life balance” had been a reality, providing workers the time and energy to focus on things that truly contribute to their well-being.

The world around us doesn’t make it any easier. The current state of affairs is disheartening, and it feels like every day brings new reasons to feel disillusioned. It’s easy to get caught up in negativity, to let it weigh you down and stifle your spirit.

But perhaps this reflection is exactly what I needed. It’s a wake-up call to reclaim my time, my energy, and my passions. It’s a chance to find a balance between the demands of daily life and the pursuits that bring me joy and to ensure that another year doesn’t pass without making an effort to connect with myself.
