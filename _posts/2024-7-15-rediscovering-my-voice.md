title: Rediscovering My Voice, A Long Overdue Update
---


It's funny how time flies. The last time I promised to write anything here was in 2019. That's right, it's been years since Iâ€™ve thought about expressing my thoughts, experiences, or even a simple update on my website. Looking back, I can't help but chuckle at the absurdity of it. How did I let so much time slip by without connecting with this space that once meant so much to me?

The truth is, I've been drained. Corporations have a way of doing that. Squeezing every last drop of energy, creativity, and passion from you. Corporate life takes the best of you and trades it with cash. Leaving you feeling like a husk of your former self. Trapped in a cycle of repetitive days and monotonous Monday mornings, doing the same thing over and over. Days turned into months, and months into years, with the grind of corporate life overshadowing everything else.

By the end of last year, I was laid off from my last job. While this initially felt like yet another blow, it turned out to be a blessing in disguise. This unexpected turn of events gave me the freedom to rediscover my true self. Since then, I've returned to spend my free time at my computer, and the constant urge to make the most of the night and weekend days because of tomorrow's work has disappeared.

In this whirlwind, I had lost sight of what truly mattered to me: my art, my creativity, and my i3wm configuration. I look back and wonder how much more I could have accomplished, how many more moments of pure artistic expression I could have enjoyed if only the so-called "work-life balance" existed, providing the time and energy to focus on things that matter to someone's well-being.

The world around us doesn't make it any easier. The current state of affairs is disheartening. It feels like every day brings new reasons to feel sorry for the way things are. It's easy to get caught up in the negativity, to let it weigh you down and stifle your spirit.

But perhaps this reflection is exactly what I needed. It's a wake-up call to reclaim my time, my energy, and my passions. To find a balance between the demands of living and the pursuits that bring me joy. To not let another year pass without making an effort to reconnect with myself.
