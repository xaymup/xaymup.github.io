title: DJ Set Spotify Playlist Generator
type: post
---
Last month, I found myself in a situation where I was invited to DJ at a birthday party where I had absolutely no idea what music to put in my set. I couldn’t help but wonder if my usual music taste would fit the mood. I needed a way to ensure my playlist would be just right. That's when I decided to build something that would help me—and others like me—navigate these musical uncertainties.

###### Building the DJ Set Generator
So, I took matters into my own hands, pulled up ChatGPT, and started working on the DJ Set Generator. The idea was simple: create a tool that helps users craft a Spotify playlist by using tags, BPM matching, and Camelot matching. I wanted to ensure that even if I wasn't deeply familiar with the music, I could still put together an impressive playlist.

I built the app using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—nothing too fancy, but it works beautifully. The design, powered by [XP.css](https://botoxparty.github.io/XP.css/), gives it a nostalgic touch that I find quite charming.

###### The Learning Experience
Working on this project has been incredibly rewarding. From the initial idea to the final product, every step was a learning experience. I faced challenges, made adjustments, and saw my vision come to life.

The real highlight has been seeing how this app can help others, whether they’re seasoned DJs or just people wanting to create a memorable playlist for a special occasion. I’ve used it myself to curate playlists and sets, knowing that each track fits perfectly with next one.

###### What's Next?
I don’t have a set plan for future updates just yet, but I’m open to ideas and improvements. If you see something coming up or have suggestions, let me know!

The app is live [here](https://xaymup.me/djset-generator/), though it requires an invitation due to Spotify's API limitations. Feel free to email me your Spotify email to include you in the API users list, or fork it with your own API key. I hope you find it as useful and enjoyable as I have. If you have any feedback or just want to chat about music and tech, feel free to reach out!
