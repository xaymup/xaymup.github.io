title: Why Egyptian Tech Companies Need to Rethink Their Hiring Practices
---

As an IT technical support engineer with extensive experience working remotely for international companies, I am increasingly frustrated with the hiring practices of tech companies in Egypt. Despite my proven track record, I am often rejected simply because I do not have a bachelor's degree. This outdated requirement disregards my skills and achievements, highlighting a broader issue within the local tech industry.

## The Experience vs. Degree Debate

In tech support, practical experience often outweighs academic qualifications. My journey through various remote roles with companies outside of Egypt has equipped me with a diverse skill set and a deep understanding of the latest technologies in web development. I have consistently delivered results and adapted to the fast-paced demands of the global tech landscape. Yet, Egyptian tech firms often dismiss any qualifications due to the lack of a bachelor's degree.

This rigid adherence to formal education overlooks the value of hands-on experience and self-taught expertise. The tech world evolves rapidly, and companies that ignore non-traditional paths to proficiency risk missing out on top talent.

## Inefficient HR Processes

Another source of frustration is the inefficiency of HR teams within Egyptian companies. Despite clearly stating the lack of a degree on my resume, I am frequently invited to interviews, often requiring significant travel and time investment. These companies proceed with the interview process only to reject me once they realize my educational background.

This practice not only wastes my time but also reflects poorly on the human resources teams within these companies. It suggests a lack of attention to detail and a disregard for the candidate's time and effort. Reading resumes thoroughly before scheduling interviews should be a basic HR practice.

## Flaws in the Educational System

My dissatisfaction extends to the educational system in Egypt, which caused me to drop out in the first place. Initially, I switched from studying dental medicine to computer science, hoping to find like-minded peers passionate about the field and eager for challenging and current educational material. Instead, I found myself surrounded by students who were merely there to obtain a degree, with no real interest in the subject matter.

The curriculum itself was severely outdated, focusing on technologies from the early 2000s, which are obsolete and irrelevant in the current job market. This lack of contemporary and engaging content not only stifled my enthusiasm but also fails to prepare students for the demands of the modern tech industry. The education systemâ€™s failure to provide relevant and up-to-date material is a significant factor in my decision to drop out and pursue my career independently.

## The Need for Change

For the Egyptian tech industry to thrive, companies and universities need to modernize their practices. Here are a few suggestions:

1. **Value Experience Over Formal Education**: Recognize the importance of practical experience and the diverse pathways individuals take to develop their skills. Assess candidates based on their capabilities, achievements, and potential rather than solely on their educational background.

2. **Streamline HR Processes**: Ensure HR teams thoroughly review a candidate's background and resume before inviting them for interviews. This can save time for both the company and the candidates and improve the overall efficiency of the hiring process.

3. **Embrace Remote Work Models**: The global shift towards remote work has shown that talent can be found anywhere. By embracing remote work, Egyptian tech companies and universities can tap into a wider talent pool and benefit from diverse perspectives.

4. **Support Continuous Learning**: Encourage a culture of continuous learning and development within tech companies and universities. Support employees and students in pursuing certifications, workshops, and online courses to keep their skills up-to-date.

5. **Modernize Educational Partnerships**: Collaborate with educational institutions to update curricula and ensure students are learning relevant, up-to-date technologies and skills that meet current industry standards.

In conclusion, the Egyptian tech industry stands to gain significantly by re-evaluating its hiring criteria and processes. By recognizing the value of experience, adapting to modern workforce trends, and addressing flaws in the educational system, companies can attract top talent and drive innovation. It's time to move beyond outdated requirements and build a more inclusive and dynamic tech community.
