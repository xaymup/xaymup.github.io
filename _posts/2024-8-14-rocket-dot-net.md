title: Joining Rocket.net
---
So I recently started working at Rocket.net, and it feels like a major turning point to me. When I first interviewed with Ben, Rocket.net’s CEO, I knew I was stepping into something different, but I had no idea just how different it would be. After spending years at various companies in the web hosting industry, each with its own approach, I can confidently say there’s nothing quite like Rocket.net.

Let me give you a quick rundown. Rocket.net offers highly optimized WordPress hosting that prioritizes speed, security, and reliability. Their infrastructure is built on a global edge network, enabling sites to achieve a global TTFB (Time to First Byte) of less than 90ms—which is seriously impressive, especially for WordPress. Plus, the entire platform is powered by a robust API that can take a web agency’s development and scaling efforts to the next level. The client dashboard? It’s user-friendly, clean, and intuitive, designed with WordPress site management in mind. This combination of a concept-driven platform, simplicity, and ease of use really sets Rocket.net apart from the crowd.

Joining this small, dynamic team has introduced me to a working culture that’s not just different, but incredibly efficient and collaborative. We all share a unified vision and work together toward a common goal—no distractions, no detours, just pure focus. For the first time in my career, I’m finding a real sense of purpose in my work as a WordPress Engineer. My journey in the web hosting industry has been a long one, but now, it feels like it's evolving from just a job into a personal mission. The environment at Rocket.net creates this atmosphere that fosters the opportunity to make a meaningful impact.

This isn’t just about getting the work done anymore; it’s about taking Rocket.net to new heights. So I am basically now all in on this journey, alongside a team that shares the same drive and ambition!
