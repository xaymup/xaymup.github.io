I"ž<p>So I recently started working at Rocket.net, and it feels like a major turning point to me. When I first interviewed with Ben, Rocket.netâ€™s CEO, I knew I was stepping into something different, but I had no idea just how different it would be. After spending years at various companies in the web hosting industry, each with its own approach, I can confidently say thereâ€™s nothing quite like Rocket.net.</p>
