I"¸<p>As an IT technical support engineer with extensive experience working remotely for international web hosting companies, I am increasingly frustrated with the hiring practices of tech companies in Egypt. Despite my proven track record, I am often rejected simply because I do not have a bachelorâ€™s degree. This outdated requirement disregards my skills and achievements, highlighting a broader issue within the local tech industry.</p>
