I"©<p>Itâ€™s funny how time flies. The last time I promised to write anything here was in 2019. Thatâ€™s rightâ€”itâ€™s been years since Iâ€™ve thought about expressing my thoughts, sharing my experiences, or even giving a simple update on my website. Looking back, I canâ€™t help but chuckle at the absurdity of it all. How did I let so much time slip by without reconnecting with this space that once meant so much to me?</p>
