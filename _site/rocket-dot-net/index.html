   <h3>Joining Rocket.net</h3><div class="date">• Written on August 14, 2024</div>

   <div class="entry">
     <p>So I recently started working at Rocket.net, and it feels like a major turning point to me. When I first interviewed with Ben, Rocket.net’s CEO, I knew I was stepping into something different, but I had no idea just how different it would be. After spending years at various companies in the web hosting industry, each with its own approach, I can confidently say there’s nothing quite like Rocket.net.</p>

<p>Let me give you a quick rundown. Rocket.net offers highly optimized WordPress hosting that prioritizes speed, security, and reliability. The Rocket.net infrastructure is built on a global edge network, enabling sites to achieve a global TTFB (Time to First Byte) of less than 90ms—which is seriously impressive, especially for WordPress. Plus, the entire platform is powered by a robust API that can just take a web agency’s development and scaling efforts to a whole new level. The client dashboard is user-friendly, clean, and intuitive, designed with WordPress—and only WordPress—site management in mind. This combination of a concept-driven platform, simplicity, and ease of use really sets Rocket.net apart from the crowd.</p>

<p>Joining this small, dynamic team has introduced me to a working culture that’s not just different, but incredibly efficient and collaborative. We all share a unified vision and work together toward a common goal—no distractions, no detours, just pure focus. For the first time in my career, I’m finding a real sense of purpose in my work as a WordPress Engineer. My journey in the web hosting industry was quite a long one, but now, it feels like it’s evolving from just a job into a personal mission. It almost feels reminiscent of coming home to someone passionate about web support. The environment at Rocket.net creates this atmosphere that fosters the opportunity to make a meaningful impact.</p>

<p>So it isn’t just about getting the work done anymore; it’s about taking Rocket.net to new heights! Just very recently, I went all in on this journey, alongside a team that shares the same drive and ambition. So excited to see what the future brings!</p>
